# HandSync

**HandSync** is an intelligent gesture recognition system that uses computer vision and machine learning to detect and interpret hand movements in real time. Designed for intuitive human-computer interaction, HandSync aims to bridge the gap between gesture-based input and digital control—whether for accessibility, sign language translation, or touchless interfaces.

# 🧪 How It Works
- Captures live video feed from webcam
- Uses MediaPipe to extract 21 hand landmarks
- Preprocesses data and feeds into a trained ML model
- Recognized gestures trigger specific actions or display labels
