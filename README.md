# HandSync

**HandSync** is an intelligent gesture recognition system that uses computer vision and machine learning to detect and interpret hand movements in real time. Designed for intuitive human-computer interaction, HandSync aims to bridge the gap between gesture-based input and digital control—whether for accessibility, sign language translation, or touchless interfaces.
